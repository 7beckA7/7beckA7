					<h3>By Dirk Schulze-Makuch</h3>
					<p>So this one has a lot of words but the ones that really stood out to me are “Having said that, there is one such case that still puzzles me”. I love it when scientists are puzzled by something from space. Infinite space = infinite possibilities, It might be a new space mineral, or it might be a space message from space aliens.</p>
					<p>Any decent scientist will acknowledge that unless something can be disproved with reproducible experiments you can’t straight up call it impossible. Unlikely, yes, but not impossible. Professor Schulze-Makuch explains that the main issue with UFOs/UAPs is that due to their nature we cannot easily study them through the scientific method.</p>

					<h2>This Is Not An Attack</h2>
					<p>The topic of extraterristial life is widely met with disbelief, moreso when talking about UFO's/UAP's. This site is not meant to attack people who scoff at the idea of aliens. If someone reads this and has a change of ear thats great, but I am not activly looking to change anyones worldview. </p>

					<h2>Dont Let Emotions Control the Evidence</h2>
					<p>I dont want to cling to false hope. If a UFO has been proven to have a terrestial origin then thats that. If an encounter is revealed to be false then oh well.</p>
				</article>
					<h2>All In Good Fun</h2>
					<p>This has not been put together by professional scientists and im sure that shows. I just think this topic is really neat.</p>
